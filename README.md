Morphia - MongoDb Springboot Examples
This repository is created by me for the very basic understanding of Morphia integration with Mongodb with some basic examples as for myself when I was going through Morphia, I couldn't find anything enough but their Documentation itself which 
helped me to understand Morphia.
So this is for someone who wants to start working with MongoDb with Morphia.
See Documentation here https://morphia.dev/
